The system tracks current electrical throughput (in kW) against <b>UTC</b> <i>(GMT)</i> time, using a <a href="https://www.your-loop.com">Loop Energy kit</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> Libraries, <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a>, <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> to store it all.
Originally Developed in April 2016. Re-written in February 2017 with significantly improved reliability (on SQLite base). Moved from DigitalOcean to Heroku in Late June 2017 to provide better reliability - as that model suits this system better
